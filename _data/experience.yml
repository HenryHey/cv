    It's been a long time already, and I've been focusing lately in my role as full stack engineer. This is my tech history since the beginning, feel free to ask for more details in any area.

    Construction of a 3D food printer proof of concept, which included:
    - Adaptation of 2 open source 3D printers into one, Reprap's electronics into Fab@Home chassis
    - Development of a wireless communication system so the printer can be accessed from WiFi

    Once we had the proof of concept working, we moved to a factory built prototype, adding an Android tablet as the interface to work with the electronics:
    - Android + NDK backend
    - Web frontend (Angular)

    From then on I've been focused on improving the CD / CI pipeline using Jenkins and AWS.

    During this time I've also developed:
    - Integrations with the Zoho ecosystem (Books, CRM and Inventory) in Node.js, and the Spanish Tax Service (SII).
    - The backend for our ecommerce website: Using Craft CMS (PHP) and also integrated with Zoho Books and using Stripe as a payment gateway.
