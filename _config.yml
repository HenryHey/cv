  Hi! Thanks for taking a look at my resume!  
  I'm currently enjoying my time at Natural Machines, playing with everything that has a computer attached to it, from system administration ( <mark>aws</mark> ) to frontend development ( <mark>php</mark>, some <mark>react</mark> ), also coding some low level android libraries ( <mark>ndk</mark> ) and even 3D modeling for 3D food printing ( <mark>blender</mark> and <mark>openscad</mark> )

  Alongside my interests in software engineering some of my other interests and hobbies are:
   - Video-games: playing, reading about them and sometimes making them.
   - Cooking: Well, actually eating, but you need the previous step.
