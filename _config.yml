  Hi! Thanks for taking a look at my profile!
  I'm currently enjoying my time at Natural Machines, playing with everything that has a computer attached to it, from systems administration to frontend development, also coding some low level android libraries and even 3D modeling for 3D food printing.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>AWS</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>
