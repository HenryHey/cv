  Software Engineer at Kiwi.com, focused on building reliable, scalable backend systems for payments and transaction processing. 

  I design event-driven/asynchronous workflows with clear domain models, and I own API design and integrations that power internal reconciliation tooling. I also enjoy improving the delivery pipeline, contributing to faster builds across services. 

  Recently, I delivered an internal FinTech reconciliation UI end-to-end, combining Next.js/TypeScript frontend work with FastAPI/Python backend APIs and event processing to support key operational workflows.

  Before Kiwi.com, I spent years building software for 3D printing companies, bridging backend, DevOps, and product-facing engineering. At BCN3D Technologies I worked on CI quality and automation, extended a 3D slicer in Python, built an end-to-end pipeline for VLM printing (Node.js/Three.js/Kubernetes), and led data platform improvements including DynamoDB→PostgreSQL migration and telemetry storage with AWS Timestream. Earlier at Natural Machines, I helped ship the Foodini ecosystem across DevOps, backend, and frontend—ranging from AWS infrastructure and CI/CD, to REST APIs communicating with hardware, to ecommerce/payment integrations.
